== AnnotationSecurity plugin for Ruby on Rails

This plugin provides a security layer for rails applications. It performs access
checks based on a behavioural description of controller actions. Security rules
are defined cleanly separated from your models and controllers.

== Installation steps

The security layer is a gem and may be installed using
<tt>gem install annotation_security</tt>.

After installing the gem, run <tt>annotation_security --rails RAILS_HOME</tt> to
integrate the security layer in your rails app. Along with the
annotation_security plugin this will add

* the AnnotationSecurity::Helper in the <tt>app/helpers</tt> folder of your
  rails-app. It provides some useful methods to create links and query the
  security layer from views.
* example configuration files to setup the security layer under <tt>config/security</tt>
* an initializer for the security layer under <tt>config/initializer</tt>

== Where to start

You can find a basic introduction how to secure your application {here}[link:files/HOW-TO.html].
In order to get a detailed idea about how things work, have a deeper look
inside AnnotationSecurity::ActionController (how to secure your application),
AnnotationSecurity::RightLoader (how to setup rights) and
AnnotationSecurity::RelationLoader (how to setup relations).

Have a look at the view methods provided by the AnnotationSecurity::Helper as
well and at the SecurityContext which is the main entry-point for security related
functionality in the layer.

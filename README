== AnnotationSecurity plugin for rails webapplications

This plugin provides a security layer for rails applications. It performs access
checks based on a behavioural description of controller actions.

== Post installation steps

Please run <tt>rake as:install_plugin</tt> in order to install files in you
rails app which are neccesary for the AnnotationSecurity plugin to work.

This will install
* the AnnotationSecurity::Helper in the <tt>app/helpers</tt> folder of your
  rails-app. It provides some useful methods to create links and query the
  security layer from views.
* example configuration files under <tt>config/security</tt>
* an initializer for the security layer under <tt>config/initializer</tt>

== Where to start

See how to {secure your application}[link:files/vendor/plugins/annotation_security/lib/annotation_security/includes/action_controller_rb.html]
and how to {setup rights}[link:files/vendor/plugins/annotation_security/lib/annotation_security/manager/right_loader_rb.html]
and {relations}[link:files/vendor/plugins/annotation_security/lib/annotation_security/manager/relation_loader_rb.html].

Also have a look at the view methods provided by the AnnotationSecurity::Helper
and at the SecurityContext which is the main entry-point for security related
stuff in this plugin.
